      If True then use the resource file named 'policyd-override' to install
      override YAML files in the service's policy.d directory.  The resource
      file should be a ZIP file containing at least one yaml file with a .yaml
      or .yml extension.  If False then remove the overrides.

      this allows you to differentiate between them.
