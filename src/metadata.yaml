summary: OpenStack Telemetry - Alarming service
maintainer: OpenStack Charmers <openstack-charmers@lists.ubuntu.com>
description: |
  Ceilometer aims to deliver a Single Point Of Contact for billing systems,
  providing all the counters they need to establish customer billing, across
  all current and future OpenStack components. The delivery of counters must be
  traceable and auditable, the counters must be easily extensible to support new
  projects, and agents doing data collections should be independent of the
  overall system.
  .
  Aodh provides the Alarming service as part of OpenStack telemetry.
